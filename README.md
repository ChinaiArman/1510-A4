### `The Journey`
Players start on the beach, and are able to see a boat way off in the distance. Their first objective is to conquer the beach and traverse to the boat. Along the way, players randomly encounter land creatures, which they must defeat via 'Flirting'. Random 'pick-up lines' are casted against the creatures, and if they are successful, the creature is defeated, added to the players inventory, and their 'Flirting' ability is increased. Players are also able to 'Fish' when adjacent to water tiles, where they have a chance to randomly acquire an item from the sea, including the legendary 'Poseidon's Trident', which greatly increases player stats. Successfuly catching any item also increases a players 'Fishing' ability. Once reaching the boat tile, players receive a heartwarming message, and unlock the boat, adding it to their inventory.

The baot gives players gain access to the rest of the map, which includes a large ocean and an island out at sea. Their next objective is to travel to the island where there are pirates to defeat. Similar to being on land, players have a random chance to encounter sea creatures, which they can either 'Fish' or 'Flirt' with to defeat. Players can also fish from their boat, similar to on land, as they are always on water when in the ocean. Once arriving at the island and encountering the pirates. Once the pirates are defeated in a 'Flirting Battle' the map reveals the Final Boss, the Leviathan.

### `The Final Battle`

The Leviathan is the ultimate test in this game, requiring players to have mastered both 'Fishing' and 'Flirting' in their journey across the sea. Once defeated, the player encounters an end screen, where they are able to recap their journey and receive a score based on how many of the game objectives were completed.
